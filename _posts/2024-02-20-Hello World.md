# Welcome to my lil blog space <3

Hello and welcome to my first ever test post here! I'm really excited to start documenting all the things that i learn and read about. This is a simple hello world post for testing purposes.

## But Why?

Learning technology is a robust and time-consuming process, similar to how we take notes to help us remember the material we have covered in class. This area will be used to record my journey and share what I've learned with everyone. ❤️

## What should you expect here?

- Programming
- Software Engineering
- Cloud Computing
- AI & Machine Learning
- Open Source Contribution
- Emerging Technologies

Lets stick around and learn :D

```go
package main
import "fmt"
func main() {
    fmt.Println("hello world")
}
```
